<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>This page should hopefully tell you what you want to know about Consumer Love. Please remember the site is still a proof-of-concept and is subject to change at any time.</p>

<p>Consumer Love was started mid-2011 with the aim of providing a new take on rating products that would allow users to see trends of products and services in different categories, whether that it be the websites they use everyday, or the supplier of car insurance. Consumer Love is constantly evolving and in its current state is more of a testing playground for myself, but will hopefully launch mid-2012.</p>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>Consumer Love is built on the <?php echo $this->Html->link('CakePHP', 'http://www.cakephp.org', array('target' => '_blank')); ?> framework and is version-controlled using <?php echo $this->Html->link('Git', 'http://git-scm.com', array('target' => '_blank')); ?> stored with the amazing <?php echo $this->Html->link('Github', 'http://github.com', array('target' => '_blank')); ?>. For javascript we use the <?php echo $this->Html->link('jQuery', 'http://jquery.com', array('target' => '_blank')); ?>  javascript library.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
